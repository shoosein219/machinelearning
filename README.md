## 2. Boosting algorithms via neural network models ##

ipynb_PY_script

1. Split and Pre-process data
2. Define model of neural network
3. Define loss and optimizer
4. Train and evaluate model

   
VIZ_1: Model integrity - (1) Training loss across epochs (2) Testing Accuracy of Model across Epochs

VIZ_2: Model integrity - heatmap/matrixviz of layer 2

VIZ_3: Feature Importance - barchart
